        <h2>Types of network</h2>
    </center>
    <h2>Local Area Network</h2><br>
    <ul>
        <li style="margin-left: 10px; "><p>A local are network(LAN)  is a computer network that interconnects computers within an limited area such as a residence,school,laboratory</p></li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Wide area Network</h2>
    <ul>
        <li style="margin-left: 10px;">
    <p>
        A wide area network(WAN) is the technology that connects your offices,data centers,cloud applications,and cloud stroage together
    </p></li>
</ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Wireless Network</h2>
    <ul>
        <li style="margin-left: 10px;"><p>
            A wireless network refers to a computer network that makes use of Radio Frequency (RF) connections between nodes in the network. Wireless networks are a popular solution for homes, businesses, and telecommunications networks.

        <h2>Devices</h2>
    </u>
    <br>
     <h3>Hub:</h3>
         <p class="sub-topics">A hub is a basically multi-port repeater. A hub connects multiple wires coming from different branches, for example, the connector in star topology which connects different stations</p>
     <h3>Bridge</h3>
         <p class="sub-topics">A bridge operates at the data link layer. A bridge is a repeater, with add on the functionality of filtering content by reading the MAC addresses of the source and destination. </p>
    <h3>Switch</h3>
        <p class="sub-topics">A switch is a multiport bridge with a buffer and a design that can boost its efficiency(a large number of ports imply less traffic) and performance. A switch is a data link layer device. The switch can perform error checking before forwarding data, which makes it very efficient as it does not forward packets that have errors and forward good packets selectively to the correct port only.</p>
    <h3>Router</h3>
        <p class="sub-topics">A router is a device like a switch that routes data packets based on their IP addresses. The router is mainly a Network Layer device. Routers normally connect LANs and WANs and have a dynamically updating routing table based on which they make decisions on routing the data packets. The router divides the broadcast domains of hosts connected through it.</p>
